# Some machine learning model
- non linear regression models: this model can be used to fit the exponential function look dataset
- KNN: KNN can be used to predict the segment to which the dataset suggests. eg. service package, stock performance pattern
- Decision Tree: can be used for condition-result style problem. eg: which drug to take under the same disease
